# PostsgreSQL-Auto-Metadata
Series of PostgreSQL triggers that will automatically generate standard based metadata.

This work was part of an internship project as part of my master degree. All the details can be found in the short summary documentation as well as the internship report. It's important to note this was never intended to be a standalone solution as it relies on a front-end component (i.e. QGIS plugin) that would perform data loading/import tasks and would trigger the PostgreSQL functions that generate the metadata.
